Essay 1: Should smart drugs be allowed in school settings?

Smart drugs, also known as nootropics have become more popular for their claims of improved mental
performance. However, the industry is not well-regulated and there could be potential health risks.
In this essay, I will provide ethical arguments for whether or not schools should allow the use
of smart drugs.

In terms of stakeholders, I believe there are two main groups. The student group has interests of personal
health, academic performance and scholarly values. I assume that parents of students also share the
same interests. On the other hand, schools in general prioritize academic integrity and excellence,
student well-being and reputation as an institution.

The first argument is that schools should hesitate to allow nootropics because there are potential
health risks. These risks threaten the safety of students. Although such substances are often marketed
as having organic ingredients, there are few medical studies that investigate the long-term effects
of consumption. The mixture of ingredients could have health implications for students as their bodies
are still growing, especially for those with existing health conditions.

The counter-argument is that banning such drugs restricts the freedom of choice of students' actions,
and this is justified through the ethical theory of Mill's Harm. According to the theory, interfering
in freedom of choice is only justified if it inflicts harm upon others. In this case, the action to
consume nootropics does not directly harm other students or parents. Hence, banning is not justified.
However, the defence is that students are generally not considered mature adults with full decision-making
capability. Hence, it should at least require parental consent to acquire and consume such drugs.

The second argument is that smart drugs should not be allowed because they confer an unfair advantage to
the user and detracts from the spirit of academic integrity. According to the World Anti-Doping Agency,
banned substances enhance performance, pose potential health risks and violate the spirit of sports.
Although individuals and circumstances are fundementally different, we should still strive to
provide an environment of fair competition and promote the spirit of excellence through hard work. I
believe that this argument applies to academic and sporting environments equally.

The last argument is that nootropics should be allowed because they can improve the academic performance
of students, allowing them to attain greater achievements or have brighter prospects. In addition,  
smart drugs can help students improve quality of life through reduced stress.

However, the counter to this is that academic performance is often not an absolute value, but measured
relative to peers. This is similar to a positional good, where the value is determined by it's
distribution or scarcity in society. Applying the positional concept to academic performance, taking smart
drugs across the board will likely not benefit any individual students, but may instead backfire and
encourage an elitist or hyper-competitive environment. Such an environment is neither desirable nor sustainable
in the long run.

As conclusion, nootropics have potential to improve mental performance and work ability. However,
I believe that it is not suitable for unregulated use in school environments.

Essay 2: Should neuroscience predictive algorithms be used for tailored sentencing?

The technology of neuroscience is advancing rapidly, and the tools and algorithms available today
are able to give greater insight into the human mind. With regards to courtrooms, the state of mind of the
the accused is crucial to know, in order to provide a just and proportionate sentence. In this essay,
I will give ethical arguments on whether such technology should be applied for tailored sentencing.

In terms of stakeholders, I believe there are three main groups. The accused person that will receive the
sentence is interested in a fair punishment, atonement and rehabilitation for the actions committed. The court
is interested in impartiality of judgement, justice and proportionate punishment. On the other hand,
society is also a stakeholder as the sentencing will determine the aspects of deterrence and retribution.

The first argument is that courts should use predictive neuroscience algorithms as it allows for a
more just and proportionate sentencing. Although current legal systems do take
into account individual circumstances, they are external indicators which are subjective to interpretation.
Withough insight into the state of mind of the accused, the current regime could under-penalize or over-penalize
its citizens, detracting from the fairness and justice of society. The algorithms will be able to give
insight into the state of mind of the
accused, allowing a more tailored treatment in the courtroom.

The first argument is that courts should not employ such techlogy as the statistical basis of the predictive
algorithms should not be applied to specific individuals, especially when lives are at stake. This can
be seen in the G2i Problem (cite). In the study, it was shown that relying solely on statistical models to
predict human behaviour would result in a large number of false negatives and false positives. This is
because the statistics represent the average human behaviour, but cannot adequately account for any
specific individual. As it stands, the general nature of the statistics detracts from the use case of specific
and tailored sentencing.

The counter-argument is that

The second argument is that the algorithms may not be reliable or interpretable. Complex predictive
algorithms can been seen as a kind of black box which is difficult to scrutinize, even for its
creators. This is a problem as algorithms can exhibit bias based on the data that it was based on. Such
biases cannot be easily corrected unless the algorithm is transparent. The opacity of such technology
makes it almost impossible to achieve complete fairness and justice in delivering insights.

The counter is that while the technology is not completely transparent, it is also not completely opaque,
as it can still provide some valuable insight through intervals of confidence. This allows court officials
to treat the algorithms with a degree of uncertainty and not as the sole factor in tailored sentencing.
However, the defence argument is that the notion of predictive uncertainty shifts the burden of judgement
back on to the judges, who do not have the technical expertise to interpret such details. Hence, it further detracts
from the transparency and objectivity of the court.
