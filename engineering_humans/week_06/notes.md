  - Week 2 & 3: Disabilities
    - Medical vs social model
      - Medical: Inherent dysfunction with body/mind deviating from "normal" functioning
      - Social: Disability from poor fit with environment, does not imply worse quality of life
    - Activity: Which is a disability?
    - Social model: Minority vs human variability
    - Therapy vs enhancement
    - Spectrum of ethical liberalism: conservative -> restrictive -> permissable
      - Videos

      - Conceptual inquiry eg freedom of choice, giftedness, disability, etc
  - Week 4: Enhancement
    - Ethical inquiry as moral discovery
      - Prefer premise/justification -> choice/conclusion
        - Not the other way around
    - Sandel vs new/liberal eugenics
    - Master/mind video
    - Applications: research, market, personal use
      - Beneficience vs non-maleficience
    - Nootropics video
  - Week 5: Cognitive Enhancement
    - Ethical aspects
      - Informed consent
      - Positional vs non-positional goods: Absolute value vs relative (comparing to others)
      - Distributive justice: inequality and equity: Socially just allocation of resources
      - Free will, agency & responsibility
      - Beneficence & non-maleficence
        - Beneficence: Balancing benefits of treatment against risks and costs
        - Maleficence: Avoiding causation of harm
      - Freedom of choice vs social obligations
    - Smart pills, neuroethics in law, wearables and BCIs
    - Neuroscience in the courtroom
      - Stakeholders: defendants, police, lawyers, judges etc
      - Applications: Competency, trial, sentencing, parole prediction
      - Sentencing vs treatment
    - G3i problem: Statistical correlations eg MRI may not accurately reflect an individual
  - Week 6: Mood modification
    - Affect, emotion, feeling etc
    - To what extent should drugs and tech be allowed to modify our emotions?
      - What should physicians do, and what is their **duty of care**?
  - Descriptive vs normative egoism
  - Mill's harm principle: The only valid reason for interfering in freedom of choice is self-protection
  - Dilemma of toleration: "Benevelontly paternalistic": Seeking to control another "for their own good"
  - Nozick's experience machine
  - Hedonism: Only pleasure motivates us / has worth
  - Breakout questions
    - How much self-deception should society allow?
      - What are the benefits and harms?
      - How to mitigate the harms and what is the duty of care of tech companies?

- Essay 1: Should nootropics be allowed in school settings?

  - Stakeholders
    - Students (and parents): Health, academic performance, values
    - School: Academic integrity and excellence, promote culture of learning, reputation
  - No, there no medical guarantees (Mill's Harm, Dilemma of toleration)
    - But there have been little to no reports of side effects
      - But if it can be considered a drug, it could be abused and hence should be regulated
        to avoid any loss of life
  - Yes, it can improve individual performance (Freedom of choice, public benefit)
    - But widespread use can be a vicious cycle of elitism
      - But the nootropic does not influence the environment; elitism is a social problem
  - No, it is considered cheating (compare to competitive sports?) (Fairness)

    - But it is relatively accessible to everyone
      - But allowing it disadvantages people who choose not to use it

  - Fukuyama and other philosophers maintain that "the original purpose of medicine is to heal
    the sick, not turn healthy people into gods"
  - Around four to seven percent of American college students are officially diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), but up to
    twenty-five percent of college students admit to trying stimulants designed for ADHD.<4>
  - Nootropics can help improve learning, reduce stress
  - School is already unfair and there is already imbalance of distributive justice
    - Academic performance is influenced by many factors including discipline, but also IQ,
      social background (computer access, tuition, etc)
  - World Anti-Doping Agency
    - Banned substances enhance performance, pose potential health risk and violate the spirit of sport
    - What is the difference between coffee/tea and nootropics?
  - Mind Lab Pro® is the world's first Universal Nootropic™ – formulated to promote a healthy,
    peak-performing mindstate known as 100% Brainpower™.

* Essay 2: Should neuroscience predictive algorithms be used for tailored sentencing?
  - Stakeholders
    - Accused: Fair treatment, atonement
    - Court: Impartiality, justice and proportionate punishment
    - Society: Deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation
  - Yes, it can allow fairer judgements on a case-by-case basis
  - No, the algorithms may not be reliable and interpretable
    - But the algorithm is objective
      - But that does not mean it is unbiased due to inherent biases in the data
      - We cannot allow a black box to determine lives (data-ism?)
  - No, the statistical basis of the predictions should not be applied to specific individuals
    - Disallowing any statistics is unreasonable since many aspects of science are based on it
      - But we cannot blindly apply statistics and predictions unless we know the confidence
        intervals and possibility of outcomes. Reasonable doubt = reasonable statistic?
  - Neuroscience and sentencing (https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37945075/Neuroscience%20and%20Sentencing.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
    - Desirable: Sentences that are fair, just and proportionate
    - Traditional purpose of sentencing: Retribution and avoiding disparity between judges
      - Result: Rigid and severe sentencing regime
  - Consequentialist view: Punishment justified only if it deters/rehabilitates offenders,
    prevents future crimes and deters others
    - Pure retributive punishment that does not prevent crime or benefit others is not justified
